# DIMEMEX-IberLEF-2024
Detection of inappropriate memes from Mexico, IberLEF 2024 Conference
In this study, we aim to address these challenges by analysing Facebook memes as part of the
DIMEMEX task of the IberLef 2024 conference. First, we will preprocess text and images. In
order to prepare the text dataset, we will make some transformations to obtain a text embedding. Same
process will be carried out with images but with a Transformer. Once we have both text and image
embeddings, we will merge them into a single embedding and train it with different models.
